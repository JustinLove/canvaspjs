- The image API (getImageData and friends) makes no sense, and is unsupported.
- Canvas save/restore is specified to leave the current path unaffected, however in postscript gsave/grestore do preserve the path.
- Properties like strokeStyle and globalAlpha are just plain old JS properties, so they stay what you set them to; canvas is supposed to ignore out-of-range alpha values, for instance.
- Alpha is unsupported in postscript, which really stinks.
- globalCompositeOperator is a pixel operation, and is unsupported.
