Things that cannot be implemented by postscript:

- The image API (getImageData and friends) makes no sense, and is unsupported.
- Canvas save/restore is specified to leave the current path unaffected, however in postscript gsave/grestore do preserve the path.
- Alpha is unsupported in postscript, which really stinks.
- globalCompositeOperator is a pixel operation, and is unsupported.

Potentially messy topics that haven't been implemented yet:

- fillStyle = 'transparent' (and equivalently, alpha 0.0) are not implemented, though in principal they could be, by state tracking.
- gradients and patterns are are not yet implemented; in principle postscript supports them, but I've put off a potentially messy topic.

Features that might possible be supported using browser-specific features:

- Properties like strokeStyle and globalAlpha are just plain old JS properties, so they stay what you set them to; canvas is supposed to ignore out-of-range alpha values, for instance.
