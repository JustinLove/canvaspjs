### Things that cannot be implemented by postscript:

- The image API (getImageData and friends) makes no sense, and is unsupported.
- Canvas save/restore is specified to leave the current path unaffected, however in postscript gsave/grestore do preserve the path.
- Alpha is unsupported in postscript, which really stinks.
- globalCompositeOperator is a pixel operation, and is unsupported.
- Shadows would require both alpha and pixel operations.  Beyond that, they are an Apple extension designed for their own use, which unfortunately made it into the spec.
- clearRect can't be implemented in a general way.  As a special case, it might be possible to detect full-screen clears and just scrap everything.  However, this gets complicated when transforms are involved.
- Executing lineTo without a path does nothing in canvas; Ghostscript for one will halt with an error.  In principle a work around would be to track the path state myself, but since drawing without a path is silly, I'm not going to support it.
- canvas arcTo specifies infinite lines under certain collinear circumstances.  Postscript arct doesn't.
- canvas specifies that zero-length lineTo segments are removed before stroking.  Postscript quite happily draws endcaps, etc.
- isPointInPath could be evaluated by the PS interpreter, but we're just recording commands for later, so this is impossible (barring complete software emulation of paths)

### Appear to be Ghostscript bugs:

- using a fat stroke on arc less than full circle will extend slightly around a connecting point.
- arc: lineWidth greater than radius creates a sun ray effect on the opposite side.

### Potentially messy topics that haven't been implemented yet:

- fillStyle = 'transparent' (and equivalently, alpha 0.0) are not implemented, though in principal they could be, by state tracking.
- gradients and patterns are are not yet implemented; in principle postscript supports them, but I've put off a potentially messy topic.

### Features that might possible be supported using browser-specific features:

- Properties like strokeStyle and globalAlpha are just plain old JS properties, so they stay what you set them to; canvas is supposed to ignore out-of-range alpha values, for instance.
- drawImage depends on browser canvas support to get at the pixel data.  So it's a no-go in IE, and Firefox 3.0 doesn't support animated images.
